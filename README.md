# Gripster (Grip Hero V2)

**Gripster** is a game controlled by a hand gripper. Every time you squeeze the gripper, it causes the bird to flap.

This project turns grip training into a game. It's part flappy bird, part endurance challenge, and it tracks your progress over time with real data.

---

## How It Works

- Squeeze the hand gripper â†’ 
- Two game modes:
  - **Strength** 
  - **Endurance Mode** 
- Grip data is collected and plotted on a graph to show improvement

---

## Why we Built This

Training grip strength is boring. Making a game out of it makes it fun, competitive, and trackable. This is great for athletes, physical therapy, or anyone looking to improve their endurance in a more engaging way. This innovative tech will revolutionize physical therapy for children struggling with Cerebral palsy, Muscular dystrophy, Juvenile arthritis, Dispraxia, Developmental coordination disorder, Spinal muscular atrophy, Brachial plexus injury.............

## What You Need

- A hand gripper connected to a microcontroller (e.g. Arduino)
- A computer running Website. 

---

## How to Play

1. Plug in the hand gripper device.
2. Run the game. 
4. Start squeezing!

---

## Data + Graphing

Endurance mode logs:
- Number of squeezes
- Duration
- (Optional) Force if you have sensors

After a session, the game generates a graph showing:
- Peak performance
- Average rate
- Progress over time 
---

## Future Ideas

- Add actual pressure sensors for better data
- Online leaderboard or multiplayer mode
- More detailed session history + CSV export
